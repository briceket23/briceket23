# Hi there, I'm Cyrille Brice FOMAZOU TCHINDA! 

👋 

**Machine Learning Researcher | Medical Image Analysis | AI for Global Health**

I am a researcher affiliated with the Laboratory of Methods at the National Higher Polytechnic School of Douala, University of Douala, Cameroon. My work focuses on democratizing AI-assisted medical diagnosis in resource-limited settings by overcoming the critical bottleneck of expert data annotation.

### 🔬 About Me

* **Current Focus:** Developing Domain-Aware Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pipelines to improve label efficiency, cross-dataset generalization, and clinical interpretability in medical imaging.


* **Mission:** Building computationally efficient, trustworthy AI diagnostic tools that can be realistically deployed on standard clinical infrastructure in malaria-endemic regions.


* **Research Highlights:** I recently developed an enhanced SimCLR-based framework with margin-augmented NT-Xent loss and hard negative mining, designed specifically for cell-level malaria classification.

### 🌟 Featured Research & Projects

**Domain-Aware SSL for Malaria Classification** 

An evidence-based AI pipeline addressing the annotation scarcity in single-cell malaria classification.

* **Label Efficiency:** Achieved **96.3% accuracy** using only **10% labeled data**, representing a 90% reduction in expert annotation burden while maintaining clinically acceptable performance.


* **Robust Generalization:** Demonstrated optimal cross-dataset zero-shot generalization (AUC = 0.777) on external datasets (BBBC041) through targeted, moderate fine-tuning.


* **Clinical Interpretability:** Systematically benchmarked 8 attribution methods, identifying **Gradient SHAP** as the optimal algorithm for clinical deployment due to its high computational efficiency (0.15s/image) and low memory overhead.


* **Domain-Specific Augmentation:** Designed biologically-motivated image augmentations (simulated focus variations, illumination correction, controlled color perturbations) to preserve critical cellular morphology.
