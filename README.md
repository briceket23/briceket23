🔬 About Me
I'm a researcher at the Laboratory of Methods, National Higher Polytechnic School of Douala (University of Douala). My work aims to break the annotation bottleneck in AI‑assisted malaria diagnosis, enabling robust models that can be deployed where expert microscopists are scarce.

Research interests: Self‑supervised learning, medical imaging, interpretability, label efficiency, and global health AI.

Current focus: Developing domain‑aware SSL frameworks that generalise across diverse microscopy protocols with minimal labelled data.

Collaboration: I actively work with clinicians and public health experts to ensure our methods translate into real‑world impact.

Key contributions:

✅ 90% reduction in annotation burden – 96.3% accuracy using only 10% labelled data (SimCLR‑based SSL).

✅ Superior cross‑dataset generalisation – optimal zero‑shot AUC (0.777) achieved with models trained on only 10% of the source data.

✅ Comprehensive interpretability benchmark – Gradient‑SHAP identified as the best trade‑off for clinical deployment (0.15s per image, CPU‑compatible).

✅ Clinical readiness – temperature‑calibrated probabilities, error analysis, and computational efficiency validated for resource‑constrained settings.
